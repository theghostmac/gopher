## Inspirations
1. The inspiration for this project is the `cargo` tool owned by Rust. As a Rust developer, I have come to love cargo, and this project is born out of that mutual love for Rust and Go.
2. Another reason I am building this is to master the use of Vim instead of smart IDEs. This idea was enforced on me by [Timothy Brymes](https://github.com/Brymes) after his first attempt at the Certified Kubernetes Administrator Exam. Hence, this project was built from the terminal alone, with Vim. 
3. The third inspiration for this project is the need for Golang to do something new. The most novel additions to the Golang toolchain is the support for Generics and the Go workspace idea, both of which are not new anymore. 
4. The final inspiration for this project is to try out the Microkernel architecture rumored to be suitable for systems programming. Normally, I would have written this tool in Rust,out of convenience and suitability of tools, but my conscience would not allow me.
